Gensim is my personal project for simulating evolution and natural selection. My aim is to improve the system and make it more generic, making it useful for actual Genetic Programming.

Status:
-------
Gensim has reached a working state but still needs a lot of improvements and has to become more general.

Build:
------
As of 20th October 2010, gensim uses CMake as it's build system. In order to build gensim, do the following:
1. Make a new directory inside this folder
2. "cd" into this directory
3. Execute "cmake ../"
